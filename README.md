 MediDetect: AI-Based Anomaly Detection in Medical Imaging

MediDetect is an innovative project at the intersection of artificial intelligence and healthcare. Leveraging cutting-edge deep learning technology, we have developed a powerful tool for automating the detection of injuries and anomalies in medical imaging data, such as X-rays and MRIs. By analyzing vast datasets of images, our AI-driven solution assists healthcare professionals in quickly and accurately identifying abnormalities, ultimately leading to faster diagnoses and improved patient outcomes. With MediDetect, we aim to transform the way medical imaging is used in clinical practice, enhancing the efficiency and precision of healthcare delivery
